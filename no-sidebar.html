												<h2>Project Inspiration: Exchange Currency Project</h2>
												<p>The inspiration for this exchange currency project comes from my personal experiences navigating the complexities of foreign exchange rates during international travel and online transactions. I often found myself frustrated by the inconsistencies in exchange rates and the lack of a user-friendly tool to track and compare rates in real-time.</p>

													One particular experience stands out: I was traveling abroad and needed to convert a significant amount of currency. I used a standard service, only to find later that I could have gotten a much better rate elsewhere. This incident sparked my interest in creating a platform that would allow users to make more informed decisions about currency conversion, ensuring they get the best possible rates.

												<h3>More intriguing information</h3>
												<p>
													As someone passionate about technology and problem-solving, I saw an opportunity to leverage my coding skills to build something that could solve this issue for others as well. The project aligns perfectly with my goal of building practical, user-focused applications that simplify everyday tasks.

This project also serves as a Portfolio Project for Holberton School, where Iâ€™m applying my technical knowledge to a real-world problem. It gives me the chance to demonstrate my ability to design, develop, and optimize a full-stack application while focusing on usability and functionality.
